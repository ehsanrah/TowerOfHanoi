Tower of hanoi is a good example of recurssive functions in computer science. 
The complexity of the problem is 2^n -1 wher n is the number of disk.
The algorithm to solve the tower of hanoi problem is the following three steps:

Step 1 − Move n-1 disks from source to aux
Step 2 − Move nth disk from source to dest
Step 3 − Move n-1 disks from aux to dest
